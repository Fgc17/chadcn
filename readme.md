## About

This package aims to cover lacking features of `shadcn/ui` while providing new ones.

Currently most of the original components are still in place, but as the project grows, more components will be added, and the existing ones will be improved.

**Main features (work in progress 🏗️)**

- Use of `@headless/ui` for building form experience.
- Tweaked `Inter` font, check `tailwind.config.js`
- Layout components

## Installation (copy and paste what you need)

Following `shadcn` design, this package will not be published to npm, just copy and paste the files you need.

The `shadcn` cli is included, so you can use `v0` stuff as well.

## Monorepo (use git submodules)

If you want to use this library inside a monorepo, you can use git submodules.

Just fork this repo and add it as a submodule to your project.
